# Smoke Sensory Panel 

This is the dataset for the sensory data from wines made from a study
on smoke exposed grapes in 2021. This data was acquired by performing over
120 micro-fermentations in accordance with the micro-fermentation protocol
from the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI). 32 different wines were
made from 4 different varietals from 4 different American Viticulture Areas
(AVAs) inside North America. Each region represents an area impacted by
the fires on the Western Coast of North America in the Fall of 2020. The
fermentations represent controls and treatments from products supplied by
Laffort. Quantitative Analysis of compounds related to the sensory charac-
ter of wines was performed by Excell Laboratories in Bordeaux France using
liquid-liquid extraction, acid-mediated hydrolysis, and Gas Chromatography
/ Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Then, in February 2021, we constructed a
virtual sensory platform where 288 winemakers, researchers, and wine in-
dustry professionals gathered using a web portal. During this virtual wine
tasting each panelist rated the intensity of fifteen wine sensory attributes
of various treatment sets. This information was gathered and a mainframe
was constructed by Daniel A. Dycus, Technical Manager for Laffort in North
America. This dataset was constructed using a blend of programming envi-
ronments including R and Python. The documentation for reporting was written 
in LaTeX. This code and mainframes are offered as a learning tool and for those 
interested in wine sensory and data science.
